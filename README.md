## Why should you choose this guide?

In this guide you will learn the basics of Noodle Extensions and Chroma's envioronment enhancement.  
- Noodle Extensions = NE
- Chroma's envioronment enhancement = EE  

I will cover the structure of the of NE and EE and analyze so effects you can see in the best rated and best modcharts.  
The reason why you should use this guide is because there aren't many guides that cover what I mentioned above.  
Unlike many other guides I will not explain how to code, nor tell you what you should use (although in this guide I will use the remapper framework made for typescript by swifter, I will show examples of plain json as well)

### This guide includes
- The basics of NE and EE
- Analyzation of well known modcharts.
- The basics of Remapper.

### This guide doesn't include
- How to set up a map(search for tutorials on youtube or go the beat saber mapping discord server)/script(for this you can go to the installation process of remapper).
- How to map/Use Chromapper.
