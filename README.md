## Is Modcharting For Me?
it's easier than ever to create a beat saber map for many reasons but you still need motivation and time for practice because without practicing and motivation you wont get far.  
If you dont have the time nor the motiviation to create a modchart then don't even bother to read the rest of the README.

## Why should You Choose This Guide?
In this guide you will learn the basics of Noodle Extensions and Chroma's envioronment enhancement.  
From now on remember that
- Noodle Extensions = NE
- Chroma's envioronment enhancement = EE  

I will cover the structure of the of NE and EE and analyze some effects you can see in the best rated and best modcharts.  
The reason why you should use this guide is because there aren't many guides that cover what I mentioned above.  
Unlike many other guides I will not explain how to code, nor tell you what you should use (although in this guide I will use the remapper framework made for typescript by swifter, I will show examples of plain json as well)

**This guide is for beginners only.**

### This guide includes
- The basics of NE and EE
- Analyzation of well known modcharts.
- The basics of Remapper.

### This guide doesn't include
- How to set up a map (search for tutorials on youtube or go the beat saber mapping discord server) or a script (for this you can go to the installation process of remapper).
- How to map/Use Chromapper.
- How to script in any language.

## Before Starting.
Check that you have the following things.
- Coding/JSON knowledge
- Beat Saber lol (better on pc and even better on steam)
- Chromapper (use dev release. change in settings. this allows to map in v3)
- Visual Studio Code (or anything that you can code in)
